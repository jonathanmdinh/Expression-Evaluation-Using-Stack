# Expression-Evaluation-Using-Stack
Evaluate an expression represented by a String. Expression can contain parentheses, you can assume parentheses are well-matched. For simplicity, you can assume only binary operations allowed are +, -, *, and /. 

Your program should read input strings from file. 
input file format: e.g. 5*(3+4) - 6  10 - 18/-2  11/ 5 * (3+3)  1/3 * 5 

Write all output result to file "project1_output.txt": output file format: 
e.g. 5 * ( 3 + 4 ) â€“ 6 = 29  
10 - 18 / -2 = 19  
11 / 5 * ( 3 + 3) = 13.2  
1 / 3 * 5 = 1.67 

Note: 
1. Your answer should round to 2 decimal places. 
2. You should solve this problem using Stack. 3. Put all your java classes in 1 file
3. Make sure your java code can be tested using Java 8.
